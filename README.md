As each choice is made, the Computer will randomly select its own choice, and they will be evaluated to see who won.  A message declaring who won the round is displayed below the player Rock, Paper, and Scissors options. The number of points for the Player, Computer, and Ties is also updated.

After the final round is played, the game ends. A message showing whether the game was won, lost, or tied is displayed above the player Rock, Paper, and Scissors options. The player options are disabled and can no longer be clicked on. The only clickable option is the Reset button to start a new game.
